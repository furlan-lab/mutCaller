# mutCaller
call mutations in 10X data


This is an archived branch of the first version of mutCaller.  This branch is maintained as it retains code for processing 10X data for use with downstream cbsniffer script.  Ultimately it was decided that cbsniffer is too slow, but this code is retained to enable direct head-to-head comparisons of modern mutcaller output with cbsniffer.
